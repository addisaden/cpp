 * Example 4: Decomposing makes everything easier...
 *
 * [ x ] greatest common divisor
 *
 * The greatest common divisor of two integers is
 * the largest number that divides them both evenly.
 * For example, gcd(12, 18) = 6, gcd(âˆ’4, 14) = 2.
 * The most efficient way to compute gcd is with
 * the Euclidean algorithm. Write a program with
 * a function to compute gcd for two integers.
 * Try doing the function without recursion
 * first - it will help you understand how the
 * algorithm works. Explicitly define your sub-tasks,
 * for example, find the code for the Euclidean
 * algorithm; create a non-recursive function for
 * the algorithm; etc. Here is our solution.
